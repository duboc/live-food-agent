# Active Context: Current Development State

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Development Area
**Voice Interruption (Barge-in) Implementation**: Implementing proper voice interruption support based on Google's ADK example to allow users to interrupt Félix mid-response.

### Active Features
- **Functional Text Chat**: Real-time conversation with Félix working via WebSocket
- **Complete Menu System**: All food items, combos, and pricing logic implemented
- **Order Management**: Full order lifecycle from item addition to finalization
- **Three-Column Interface**: Menu | Chat | Order display working effectively
- ✅ **Voice Interruption Support**: Implemented using InMemoryRunner and proper async handling

### Current Development State
The system now supports **voice interruption (barge-in)** functionality:
- ✅ Félix AI agent responds appropriately in Spanish
- ✅ Menu browsing and item selection functional
- ✅ Order tracking and total calculation working
- ✅ Combo suggestions and upselling logic implemented
- ✅ WebSocket real-time communication established
- ✅ Audio processing with interruption support implemented
- ✅ Users can interrupt Félix while he's speaking

## Recent Changes & Patterns

### Voice Interruption Implementation (2025-01-08)
**Key Changes Made**:
1. **InMemoryRunner**: Switched from `Runner` to `InMemoryRunner` for built-in interruption handling
2. **Async Session Creation**: Made `start_agent_session` async and properly await runner operations
3. **Task Management**: Changed from `asyncio.gather` to `asyncio.wait` with `FIRST_EXCEPTION`
4. **Resource Cleanup**: Added `live_request_queue.close()` on WebSocket disconnect
5. **Stream Processing**: Removed unnecessary `while True` loop from agent messaging

**Why These Matter**:
- InMemoryRunner has built-in mechanisms for handling interruptions
- Proper async/await ensures events are processed in real-time
- asyncio.wait allows immediate reaction to exceptions/interruptions
- Resource cleanup prevents memory leaks and ensures clean disconnects

### Established Patterns
1. **Tool-First Development**: Each business function implemented as discrete tool
2. **Session-Based State**: Using `session_id` for order isolation
3. **Spanish-First Design**: All prompts, responses, and UI text in Spanish
4. **Combo-Driven Sales**: Félix always leads with combo suggestions for higher value
5. **Interruption-Aware Audio**: Voice interactions support natural conversation flow

### Code Organization Patterns
- **Modular Tools**: Each function in `tools.py` handles specific business logic
- **Personality Centralization**: All Félix behavior defined in `prompts.py`
- **Clear Separation**: Agent config, business logic, and UI completely separated
- **Development Simplicity**: In-memory storage for rapid iteration
- **Async-First Design**: All critical paths use proper async/await patterns

## Next Steps & Active Considerations

### Immediate Development Priorities

#### 1. Enhanced Audio System ✅ COMPLETED
- **Smart Text Filtering**: Implemented order-detection logic to show only relevant messages in audio mode
- **Clean Audio UI**: Added visual feedback with green accent colors and "MODO VOZ ACTIVO" indicator
- **Audio Mode Styling**: Enhanced chat section with audio-specific CSS classes and animations
- **Order Detection**: Intelligent filtering based on Spanish keywords, prices, and product names
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear audio status with pulsing animations and enhanced recording feedback
- **Voice Interruption**: ✅ Users can now interrupt Félix mid-sentence for natural conversation

#### 2. Testing Voice Interruption
- **Verify Interruption Flow**: Test that user speech properly interrupts agent responses
- **Check Event Handling**: Ensure `event.interrupted` flag is properly processed
- **Audio Stream Continuity**: Confirm smooth transition when interrupting
- **Multiple Interruptions**: Test rapid successive interruptions

#### 3. Production Readiness
- **State Persistence**: Replace in-memory `pedidos_en_proceso` with database
- **Session Management**: Implement proper session cleanup and expiration
- **Error Resilience**: Handle WebSocket disconnections and API failures
- **Interruption Logging**: Add metrics for voice interruption usage

### Technical Decisions Under Consideration

#### Session Management Strategy
**Current**: Unique session IDs with InMemoryRunner's built-in session service
**Benefits**: 
- Automatic session lifecycle management
- Built-in support for interruption state
- Clean separation of sessions

#### Audio Processing with Interruptions
**Current**: Base64 encoding with interruption-aware streaming
**Working Well**:
- Immediate response to user voice input
- Clean stopping of agent audio output
- Proper event sequencing with turn_complete/interrupted flags

## Active Insights & Learnings

### Voice Interruption Success
1. **InMemoryRunner Critical**: The runner type directly affects interruption capabilities
2. **Async Patterns Matter**: Proper async/await ensures real-time event processing
3. **Task Management**: asyncio.wait vs gather makes a significant difference
4. **Event Flags**: `interrupted` and `turn_complete` provide clear state management

### Development Efficiency Insights
- **Google Examples Valuable**: ADK examples provide best practices for complex features
- **Runner Selection Important**: Different runners have different capabilities
- **WebSocket Lifecycle**: Proper cleanup prevents resource leaks
- **Event-Driven Design**: Interruptions work best with event-based architecture

### User Experience Observations
- **Natural Conversation**: Voice interruption makes interactions feel more human
- **Reduced Frustration**: Users don't have to wait for Félix to finish
- **Improved Engagement**: Ability to interrupt increases conversation flow
- **Cultural Fit**: Spanish speakers expect conversational interruptions

## Current Technical Implementation

### Voice Interruption Architecture
```python
# Key components for interruption support:
1. InMemoryRunner with built-in session service
2. Async session creation and management
3. LiveRequestQueue for bidirectional streaming
4. Event-based message handling with interruption flags
5. Proper task lifecycle with asyncio.wait
```

### Event Flow for Interruptions
1. User speaks while agent is responding
2. Audio stream sent via WebSocket
3. LiveRequestQueue processes incoming audio
4. Agent recognizes interruption
5. Current response stopped, `interrupted: true` sent
6. New user input processed immediately

## Success Metrics Being Tracked
- **Order Completion Rate**: Percentage of conversations that result in finalized orders
- **Average Order Value**: Impact of Félix's upselling on order totals
- **User Engagement**: Length of conversations and repeat interactions
- **Audio Usage**: Preference for voice vs text interaction modes
- **Interruption Frequency**: How often users interrupt Félix (indicates natural flow)

This active context reflects successful implementation of voice interruption support, moving the project closer to production-ready natural conversation capabilities.
