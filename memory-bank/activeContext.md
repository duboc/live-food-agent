# Active Context: Current Development State

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Development Area
**Audio System Enhancement**: The project has a working foundation with text-based interactions, and current focus appears to be on refining the audio/voice capabilities for Spanish-language interactions.

### Active Features
- **Functional Text Chat**: Real-time conversation with FÃ©lix working via WebSocket
- **Complete Menu System**: All food items, combos, and pricing logic implemented
- **Order Management**: Full order lifecycle from item addition to finalization
- **Three-Column Interface**: Menu | Chat | Order display working effectively

### Current Development State
The system is **functionally complete** for core ordering operations:
- âœ… FÃ©lix AI agent responds appropriately in Spanish
- âœ… Menu browsing and item selection functional
- âœ… Order tracking and total calculation working
- âœ… Combo suggestions and upselling logic implemented
- âœ… WebSocket real-time communication established
- ðŸ”„ Audio processing components present but may need refinement

## Recent Changes & Patterns

### Established Patterns
1. **Tool-First Development**: Each business function implemented as discrete tool
2. **Session-Based State**: Using `session_id` for order isolation (currently "default" for development)
3. **Spanish-First Design**: All prompts, responses, and UI text in Spanish
4. **Combo-Driven Sales**: FÃ©lix always leads with combo suggestions for higher value

### Code Organization Patterns
- **Modular Tools**: Each function in `tools.py` handles specific business logic
- **Personality Centralization**: All FÃ©lix behavior defined in `prompts.py`
- **Clear Separation**: Agent config, business logic, and UI completely separated
- **Development Simplicity**: In-memory storage for rapid iteration

## Next Steps & Active Considerations

### Immediate Development Priorities

#### 1. Audio System Validation
- **Test Spanish Voice Quality**: Ensure "Leda" voice sounds natural for fast food context
- **Audio Latency Optimization**: Minimize delay between speech input and response
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to text when audio fails

#### 2. Production Readiness
- **State Persistence**: Replace in-memory `pedidos_en_proceso` with database
- **Session Management**: Implement proper session cleanup and expiration
- **Error Resilience**: Handle WebSocket disconnections and API failures

#### 3. User Experience Refinement
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure three-column layout works on mobile devices
- **Audio Controls**: Clear start/stop recording indicators
- **Visual Feedback**: Order updates and confirmation animations

### Technical Decisions Under Consideration

#### Session Management Strategy
**Current**: Single "default" session for development
**Decision Needed**: 
- Generate unique session IDs per user
- Implement session expiration (30 minutes inactive?)
- Add session cleanup background task

#### Storage Evolution
**Current**: Python dictionary `pedidos_en_proceso`
**Options**:
- SQLite for simple persistence
- PostgreSQL for production scaling
- Redis for distributed caching

#### Audio Processing Optimization
**Current**: Base64 encoding over WebSocket
**Considerations**:
- Compression for bandwidth efficiency
- Chunk size optimization for latency
- Browser compatibility testing

## Active Insights & Learnings

### Successful Patterns
1. **FÃ©lix's Personality Works**: The enthusiastic Spanish character creates engagement
2. **Combo-First Strategy**: Leading with value deals increases order value
3. **Real-time Updates**: Live order tracking improves user confidence
4. **Tool Architecture**: Modular functions make testing and debugging easier

### Development Efficiency Insights
- **Prompt Engineering Critical**: FÃ©lix's effectiveness comes from detailed personality prompts
- **WebSocket Simplicity**: Direct JSON messaging more reliable than complex protocols
- **Menu Integration**: Clickable menu items reduce typing friction significantly
- **State Transparency**: Debug endpoints (`/debug/pedidos`) essential for development

### User Experience Observations
- **Spanish Language Preference**: Native Spanish speakers respond better to FÃ©lix than English AI
- **Visual + Audio**: Users prefer seeing order build up while talking to FÃ©lix
- **Natural Language**: Users don't use exact menu names, FÃ©lix handles variations well
- **Combo Education**: Users learn about savings through FÃ©lix's explanations

## Current Technical Constraints

### Development Environment
- **Single Server**: No distributed session management
- **Memory Limitations**: Orders lost on server restart
- **API Dependencies**: Requires active Google API key for all functionality

### Known Issues to Address
- **Session Persistence**: Orders disappear if browser refreshes
- **Audio Browser Support**: Some browsers may have WebRTC compatibility issues
- **Mobile Layout**: Three-column design may need responsive breakpoints
- **Error Messages**: Generic errors don't guide users effectively

## Working Assumptions

### User Behavior
- Users prefer voice interaction for speed
- Visual menu helps with discovery
- Order confirmation critical before payment
- Spanish cultural expressions (estrella, campeÃ³n) resonate positively

### Technical Approach
- WebSocket overhead acceptable for real-time experience
- In-memory state sufficient for development and early deployment
- Google Gemini Live provides sufficient Spanish language quality
- Three-column layout provides optimal information density

## Success Metrics Being Tracked
- **Order Completion Rate**: Percentage of conversations that result in finalized orders
- **Average Order Value**: Impact of FÃ©lix's upselling on order totals
- **User Engagement**: Length of conversations and repeat interactions
- **Audio Usage**: Preference for voice vs text interaction modes

This active context reflects a project in the refinement phase, with core functionality working and focus shifting to user experience optimization and production readiness.
